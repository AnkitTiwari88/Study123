TESTNG LISTENER:
TestNG provides the @Listeners annotation which listens to every event that occurs in a selenium code. 
Listeners are activated either before the test or after the test case. 
It is an interface that modifies the TestNG behavior.

For example, when you are running a test case either through selenium or appium and suddenly a test case fails. 
We need a screenshot of the test case that has been failed, to achieve such scenario, TestNG provides a mechanism, i.e., Listeners.
When the test case failure occurs, then it is redirected to the new block written for the screenshot.
